## [0.3.1] - 2025-01-27

### Fixed
- **BREAKING**: Fixed deprecated Hibernate API usage in BaseRepositoryImpl

### Added
- Enhanced transaction management in BaseRepositoryImpl with new helper methods:
  - `executeInTransaction()` for operations that return values
  - `executeInTransactionVoid()` for void operations
  - Both methods include proper rollback handling for improved reliability

### Technical Details
- Improved error handling in repository operations
- Better transaction safety with automatic rollback on exceptions
- Removed FIXME comments related to deprecated API usage
